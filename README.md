###Project Overview: Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform

##Student: Ali Layan Thohir

##Course: CST1510 - CW2

##What’s the Project?
I’m building a web dashboard using Python and Streamlit for three types of professionals: Cybersecurity Analysts, Data Scientists, and IT Operations Managers. The system tailors itself to each user’s role, showing them only the tools they need.

##What Problem Does It Solve?

Cybersecurity: Helps analysts quickly respond to threats or attacks and spot potential issues.

Data Science: Makes it easier to clean up and organize messy datasets.

IT Operations: Tracks which staff or processes are slowing down helpdesk tickets.

The goal is to make data more useful, turning numbers into actionable insights.

##What Am I Building?
Here’s a quick rundown of the tech stack and features:

Secure Login: Started with text files, now it’s powered by a database.

Database: Using SQLite for managing users, incidents, datasets, and tickets. CRUD operations keep it running smoothly.

Web Dashboard: Designed with Streamlit for easy navigation and smooth functionality.

Analytics & AI: Adding charts for data visualization and an optional AI assistant for security questions.

OOP Refactoring: Refactoring the code into classes (User, SecurityIncident, Dataset, ITTicket) to make it scalable and maintainable.
